This week the project partners came together in Munich for the break-off
milestone meeting.

## Break-off Milestone

Eighteen months into the project that began in May 2024 it was time to report on
the project status. Our project manager [VDI/VDE IT](https://vdivde-it.de/) and
all partners were invited to Munich to present and discuss the work.

A focus of the meeting was to ensure the interoperability of all the components
laid out in the project plan.
For this each partner presented their findings. We could demonstrate that there
are no contradictions to the planned implementations.

### Work package presentations

After Prof. Wallentowitz gave the project overview, we focused on the three
technical pillars of the project:

Yannick Lavan from
[TU Darmstadt](https://www.esa.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) shared the
simulation speed improvements made possible with co-simulation and presented
the implemented specification additions for the instruction set extensions.

Next was Philipp Fengler from [TU
München](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/eda/startseite/) and Tavia Plattenteich from
[Universität zu Lübeck](https://www.iti.uni-luebeck.de/nc/home.html)
with a deep dive into open-source tools for verification of non-functional
instruction set extension properties, focusing on timing behavior and power
estimation.

Tobias Wölfel from [HM](https://aemy.cs.hm.edu/) presented the verification flow
with extracting assertions from instruction set extensions, consuming
them with CIRCT, and how this can be connected to Yosys.

## Outlook

This meeting marked the midpoint of the project.
We already started with implementations and submitting papers to the research
community.
This work will now continue.
With more implementation results, the open-source contributions will increase,
as will the scientific publications.
