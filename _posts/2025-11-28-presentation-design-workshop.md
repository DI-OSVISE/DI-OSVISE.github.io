We presented our work in OSVISE at the DE:Sign workshop _Digital Verification_
organized by Chip Design Germany in Hanover.

## DE:Sign workshop _Digital Verification_

Chip Design Germany organized a workshop to enable an exchange between all the
participants of projects funded within the DE:Sign initiative.
The workshop took place at the Institute of Microelectronic Systems of Leibniz
University Hannover.

After a welcome by Prof. Holger Blume the participants reported on the current
status of the projects. A focus was the exchange of updates and usage of
open-source tools to further align the work between the teams.

The team of Prof. Payá-Vayá from the Chair of Chip Design for Embedded Computing
from TU Braunschweig reported on their work on
[PATARA](https://github.com/tubs-eis/PATARA) and
[EIS-V](https://github.com/tubs-eis/EIS-V).
The startup MachineWare showed their work on virtual prototypes and shared their
experience of handling open-source projects and business needs.

### OSVISE

The OSVISE project was represented by Yannick Lavan from
[TU Darmstadt](https://www.esa.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) and Tobias Wölfel
from [HM](https://aemy.cs.hm.edu/).
They gave an overview of the work in OSVISE in general as well as a status
update.
Both gave the participants a more detailed introduction into their respective
focus areas within the OSVISE project.
Yannick showed his work on improving simulation speeds for RISC-V instruction
set extensions.
Tobias gave an introduction to [CIRCT](https://circt.llvm.org/) and
[MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) and the design verification with SystemVerilog
assertions.

## Outlook

Chip Design Germany will organize more workshops in the future. We are looking
forward to more meetings that strengthen research collaboration and advance chip
design development in Germany.
